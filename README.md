# unreal-generalist-certification-project-sanatorio

### Description

This game's level is based on El Sanatorio Duran (real location).

#### Notes:

- Re-add the Starter Content asset pack after opening for the first time.
- Map is located in 0,0 so move landscape to (X=-94600.000000,Y=-54000.000000,Z=-6100.000000). But to fix the orientation without moving the map locate landscape at (X=54000.000000,Y=-94600.000000,Z=-6100.000000) and rotate to (Pitch=0.000000,Yaw=90.000000,Roll=0.000000).

#### To Do:
- Fix museum roof with a triangle with the two top vertices moved towards their opposite sides.
